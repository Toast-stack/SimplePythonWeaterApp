Real-Time Weather Application
A Python-based command-line application that fetches real-time weather data for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. This project highlights skills in API integration, JSON data handling, and terminal-based user interaction.

Features
Fetches current weather details, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions.

Handles errors for invalid city names and connectivity issues.

Simple structure designed for scalability (e.g., adding forecasts or a GUI).

Requirements
Python 3.7+

Install dependencies:

bash
pip install requests
OpenWeatherMap API key (free from OpenWeatherMap).

How to Run
Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:

bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd WeatherApp
Replace the API_KEY in weather_app.py with your OpenWeatherMap API key.

Run the app:

bash
python weather_app.py
Enter a city name to see the weather or type exit to quit.

Future Enhancements
Multi-day weather forecasts.

Graphical user interface.

Real-time data visualization.

Why It Matters
This project demonstrates practical coding skills, including API integration, scalable design, and error handling. It serves as a foundation for developing more advanced, data-driven applications.
